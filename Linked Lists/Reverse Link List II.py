'''
Reverse a linked list from position m to n. Do it in-place and in one-pass.

For example:
Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, m = 2 and n = 4,

return 1->4->3->2->5->NULL.

 Note:
Given m, n satisfy the following condition:
1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ length of list. Note 2:
Usually the version often seen in the interviews is reversing the whole linked list which is obviously an easier version of this question.
